#Dancountability
This is a small prooof-of-concept for an app.  I'm going to use it to keep track of things that I do frequently, so I can see how often I do them over the course of the day, and see how that trendline appears from day to day.  Eventually there will be pretty graphs.

Today the UI is Slack, because I didn't want to bother with any OAuth or identity federation yet.  Also, the source of record is only set up for one user.  Eventually I will change it up so I can keep track of individual users.  The road map for this is like 3 years long.  Also, it won't be called Dancountability when it is finished.
